# French Press Method - Rich & Frothy Vee/Ra

The French press method creates a rich, full-bodied Vee/Ra experience with beautiful froth and deep flavor extraction. This traditional brewing technique is perfect for those who appreciate the ritual of preparation.

## What You'll Need

- Your chosen Vee/Ra blend
- French press (8-12 cup capacity recommended)
- Hot water (just off the boil)
- Timer
- Spoon for stirring

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Preheat Your French Press
Pour a small amount of hot water into your French press to warm it up, then discard the water.

### Step 2: Add Your Blend
Measure 1-2 teaspoons of your Vee/Ra blend into the French press.

### Step 3: Pour Hot Water
Slowly pour 8-12 ounces of hot water (just off the boil) over your blend, ensuring all the powder is saturated.

### Step 4: Stir Gently
Use a spoon to gently stir the mixture, ensuring all the blend is fully dissolved.

### Step 5: Steep and Plunge
Let the mixture steep for 3-5 minutes, then slowly press down the plunger to create that signature froth.

### Step 6: Pour and Enjoy
Pour into your favourite cup, taking care to preserve the beautiful froth on top.

## Pro Tips

- **Water Temperature**: Use water that's just off the boil (200°F/93°C) for optimal extraction
- **Steeping Time**: 3-5 minutes is ideal - longer steeping creates stronger flavor
- **Plunging Technique**: Press down slowly and steadily for the best froth
- **Clean Up**: Rinse your French press immediately after use for easy cleaning

## Why This Method Works

The French press method allows for gentle extraction of the botanical compounds while creating a rich, full-bodied texture. The plunging action creates beautiful froth that enhances the drinking experience.

Perfect for: Afternoon rituals, evening wind-down, or when you want to savor the full depth of your Vee/Ra blend.
