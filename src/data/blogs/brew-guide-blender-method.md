# Blender Method - Perfect Smooth Vee/Ra

The blender method is our most popular brewing technique for creating smooth, frothy Vee/Ra botanical blends. This method creates a luxurious texture that's perfect for both hot and cold preparations.

## What You'll Need

- Your favorite Vee/Ra blend (Ritual Roots, Moon Mylk, or Mood Magick)
- High-speed blender (Vitamix, Blendtec, or similar)
- Hot water (just off the boil)
- Optional: Plant milk, honey, or other additions

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Blend
Measure out 1-2 teaspoons of your chosen Vee/Ra blend into your blender container.

### Step 2: Add Hot Water
Pour 8-12 ounces of hot water (just off the boil) over your blend. The hot water helps extract the full flavor and medicinal properties.

### Step 3: Blend to Perfection
Start on low speed and gradually increase to high. Blend for 30-60 seconds until you achieve a smooth, frothy consistency.

### Step 4: Enjoy Your Ritual
Pour into your favorite cup and take a moment to appreciate the beautiful froth and aroma before sipping.

## Pro Tips

- **Temperature Matters**: Use water that's just off the boil (around 200°F/93°C) for optimal extraction
- **Blend Time**: 30-60 seconds is perfect - longer blending creates more froth
- **Additions**: Try adding a splash of plant milk for extra creaminess
- **Storage**: Best enjoyed immediately, but can be stored in the fridge for up to 24 hours

## Why This Method Works

The blender method creates a perfect emulsion of all the botanical compounds, ensuring you get the full spectrum of benefits from your Vee/Ra blend. The high-speed blending breaks down the ingredients into easily digestible particles while creating that signature frothy texture.

Perfect for: Morning rituals, post-workout recovery, or anytime you want a smooth, luxurious Vee/Ra experience.
