# Jar Shaking Method - Mood Magick

The jar shaking method is the simplest and most accessible way to brew your Mood Magick blend. All you need is a jar and your hands - perfect for travel, camping, or when you want a quick ritual.

## What You'll Need

- Mood Magick blend (1½ - 2 Tbsp / 15g)
- Mason jar or similar container with tight-fitting lid
- Hot water (just off the boil)
- Timer (optional)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Jar
Ensure your jar is clean and has a tight-fitting lid. A 16-ounce mason jar works perfectly.

### Step 2: Add Your Mood Magick
Measure 1½ - 2 Tbsp (15g) of Mood Magick into the jar.

### Step 3: Pour Hot Water
Add 8-12 ounces of hot water (just off the boil) to the jar, leaving some space at the top.

### Step 4: Secure the Lid
Screw on the lid tightly to prevent any spills during shaking.

### Step 5: Shake Vigorously
Shake the jar vigorously for 30-60 seconds. You'll see the mixture become smooth and frothy.

### Step 6: Let It Settle
Allow the mixture to settle for 1-2 minutes, then enjoy your perfectly brewed Mood Magick.

## Pro Tips

- **Jar Size**: Use a jar that's larger than your serving size to allow room for shaking
- **Shaking Technique**: Hold the jar with both hands and shake in a circular motion
- **Temperature**: Use hot water for best results, but warm water works too
- **Travel Friendly**: This method is perfect for taking your Mood Magick ritual on the go

## Why This Method Works

The jar shaking method creates a simple emulsion that effectively combines all the botanical compounds in your Mood Magick blend. The shaking action helps break down the ingredients and creates a smooth, drinkable consistency.

Perfect for: Travel, camping, office rituals, or when you want a simple, no-fuss Mood Magick brewing method.
