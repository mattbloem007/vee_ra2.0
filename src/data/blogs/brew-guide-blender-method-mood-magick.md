# Blender Method - Mood Magick

The blender method creates a smooth, frothy texture that enhances the absorption of the beneficial compounds in your Mood Magick blend. This method is perfect for those who prefer a creamy, well-mixed beverage with excellent bioavailability.

## What You'll Need

- Mood Magick blend (1½ - 2 Tbsp / 15g)
- High-speed blender (Vitamix, Blendtec, or similar)
- Hot water (just off the boil)
- Optional: Plant milk, honey, or other additions

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Your Mood Magick
Measure out 1½ - 2 Tbsp (15g) of Mood Magick into your blender container.

### Step 2: Add Hot Water
Pour 8-12 ounces of hot water (just off the boil) over your blend. The hot water helps extract the full flavor and medicinal properties.

### Step 3: Blend to Perfection
Start on low speed and gradually increase to high. Blend for 30-60 seconds until you achieve a smooth, frothy consistency.

### Step 4: Enjoy Your Ritual
Pour into your favourite cup and take a moment to appreciate the beautiful froth and aroma before sipping.

## Pro Tips

- **Temperature Matters**: Use water that's just off the boil (around 200°F/93°C) for optimal extraction
- **Blend Time**: 30-60 seconds is perfect - longer blending creates more froth
- **Additions**: Try adding a splash of plant milk for extra creaminess
- **Storage**: Best enjoyed immediately, but can be stored in the fridge for up to 24 hours

## Why This Method Works

The blender method creates a perfect emulsion of all the botanical compounds, ensuring you get the full spectrum of benefits from your Mood Magick blend. The high-speed blending breaks down the ingredients into easily digestible particles while creating that signature frothy texture.

Perfect for: Morning rituals, post-workout recovery, or anytime you want a smooth, luxurious Mood Magick experience.
